# Where do I go?

I made 2 sections here for a reason:

## UEFI BOIz

You can check the UEFI section for your work, read `UEFI + GPT = BFF` first then go to your actual installation section.

## BIOS \(Legacy\) BOIz

You go the other Legacy section to get it working too.

## Other sections:

Fix Clovy Clovy to Fix Clover

InS - QnA, a FAQ on some common issues.
